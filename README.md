# World War Bot

Dumb algorithm for finding the ultimate warmonger

I stole the country data from https://github.com/lorey/list-of-countries

The procedure works as follows:

        - Pick a random country
        - Pick a random neighbour of that country
        - Choose a probability of victory for the countries based on relative population
        - Choose a winner based on a random number choice and the calculated probability of victory
        - Transfer the loser's population and borders to the winner

    Repeat until only one country remains.

Performing this procedure 10,000 times returns the following rankings:

 - China: 6907
 - India: 2419
 - United States: 539
 - Brazil: 59
 - Russia: 12
 - Nigeria: 7
 - Germany: 7
 - Pakistan: 7
 - Ethiopia: 6
 - United Kingdom: 5
 - Egypt: 5
 - Dominican Republic: 4
 - Democratic Republic of the Congo: 4
 - Guadeloupe: 3
 - France: 3
 - Colombia: 3
 - Iran: 2
 - Ivory Coast: 1
 - Sint Maarten: 1
 - Poland: 1
 - South Africa: 1
 - Turkey: 1
 - Spain: 1
 - Kenya: 1
 - Argentina: 1
